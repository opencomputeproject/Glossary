Dry-Bulb Temperature (DBT),"A measure of the heat stress Dry Bulb Temperature refers basically to the ambient air temperature. It is called ""Dry Bulb"" because the air temperature is indicated by a thermometer not affected by the moisture of the air.  Sometimes referred to as Tdb, it can be measured using a normal thermometer freely exposed to the air but shielded from radiation and moisture. The temperature is usually given in degrees Celsius (oC) or degrees Fahrenheit (oF). The SI unit is Kelvin (K).","Promersion: Suggest simplification to the following

Wet-Bulb Temperature (WBT),"A measure of the heat stress Wet Bulb temperature is the temperature of adiabatic saturation. This is the temperature indicated by a moistened thermometer bulb exposed to the air flow. It can be measured by using a thermometer with the bulb wrapped in wet muslin. The adiabatic evaporation of water from the thermometer and the cooling effect is indicated by a ""wet bulb temperature"" lower than the ""dry bulb temperature"" in the air. The rate of evaporation from the wet bandage on the bulb, and the temperature difference between the dry bulb and wet bulb, depends on the humidity of the air. The evaporation is reduced when the air contains more water vapor.  The wet bulb temperature is always lower than the dry bulb temperature but will be identical with 100% relative humidity (the air is at the saturation line).  Takes into account direct sunlight, humidity, wind speed, sun angle, and cloud cover (solar radiation).","Promersion: Suggest simplification to the following
